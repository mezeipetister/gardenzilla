***

Here we wrote all the technical questions
and solutions that we use in development.

Backlog

    Catalog
    =======

    Core product data such as
    name, description, manufacturer

    Q:  Physical data? For service?
        What about product and package Physical
        dimensions? Should we store all together,
        like width, height, length and weight?

    Q:  Product badges? How to manage product category
        specific variables, such as hazard category, or
        any specific authority permit?

    Q:  How to manage stock for services? Physical products
        have stock and stock management, but a service does
        not have in any cases. There could be products with
        stock management and without stock management.

    Source
    ======
    
    Multiple source per product. Place to find
    source and related price.

    Q:  Each product could be sourcable from multiple sources.
        And price might vary between orders within the same source.
        Should we manage source price history?

    Q:  How to update source product price? Based on the actual order
        price? And auto sync, or just suggest to update? Should we manage
        two prices? One list price and one real/historical price?

    Custom Product Inventory
    ========================

    Register each product individually, and design the whole sales
    process based on it. Better expiration date management, better
    product and service quality, added marketing potential based on
    the custom branded QR code per product.
